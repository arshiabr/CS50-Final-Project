#### Description:
This is a Data base Project for selling and Booking tickets and managing customers; This Projects contains a database of customers, their tickets, their IDs, their account informations, the tickets' informations, chair numbers, hall number, prices and other details and specifications in Farsi.

Further we have written some Queries for exporting desired number of customers in format of tables with their details and informations based on the different conditions and requests people have faced in this service; I have uploaded the Screenshots of each Query codes with the final results in the arranged tables in the PREJECT DOCUMENTATION PDF file and I have explained each of them completely there.
as you see, here i have written 6 queries for this project and they are listed bellow with their explanation and final results (again based on different examples and situations).
